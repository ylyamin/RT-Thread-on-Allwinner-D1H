# D1-1. Introduction
[Index](D1_0_index.md) | [Next chapter](D1_2_boot_process.md)

With this introduction I am beginning a series of articles about hobby experimentation with [Allwinner D1H](https://d1.docs.aw-ol.com/en/) RISC-V MCU and the [RT-Thread](https://www.rt-thread.io/) Operating System.<br>
The code is available at: https://github.com/ylyamin/RT-Thread-on-Allwinner-D1H <br>
Discussion: https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/r-01-risc-v-baremetal-with-rt-thread-lcd-work-usb-in-progress/14683<br>

Next chapters will describe:
- [D1-2. Boot process](D1_2_boot_process.md) - Existing best practices for Allwinner D1H bootloaders, examples of booting Linux and RT-Thread, using JTAG and GDB.
- [D1-3. RT-Thread overview and Build](D1_3_rtt_overview_and_build.md) - An overview of the RT-Thread structure and libraries. Compile RT-Thread for the Allwinner D1H platform.
- [D1-4. Makefile and Hardware changes](D1_4_make_and_hw.md) - My repository structure, Makefile and Hardware changes that needed to be done.
- [D1-5. LCD Display driver](D1_5_lcd_driver.md) - Display driver for [ClockworkPi DevTerm R-01](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-devterm), [uConsole R-01](https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole) and [Sipeed Lichee RV](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/lichee/RV/Dock.html).
- [D1-6. USB Keyboard](D1_6_usb_keyboard.md) - USB Keyboard driver for ClockworkPi DevTerm, still not work.

Long story short:<br>
Initially my dream was to understand how Operating System work at a low level mean: scheduler, memory management and drivers.<br>
And with Allwinner D1H my dream has come true ... sort of.<br>
Now seems my hobby is reverse engineering Allwinner products.<br>

I'm not professional programmer, at the beginning thought that studying OS by diving to Linux Kernel will be too complex and I need to start from ground. Interested in the RISC-V architecture. Play with RISC-V virtualizer is good but not so fun. I want real hardware but without lots of wires, oscilloscope and soldering, just ready-made solution with user input and output to a display (later at some point I bought a soldering iron).<br>

Found [ClockworkPi DevTerm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-devterm) Open Source Portable retro-entertainment Terminal with supports  various core ARM and RISC-V.

And an additional it can have module: R-01 core with 64-bit RISC-V MCU and 1GB DDR3 memory. Inside R-01 Allwinner D1H  RISC-V SoC - and is where I found pain.<br>

I thought if Linux can run on this chip, then I could definitely implement some bare-metal drivers. But in reality, the Allwinner documentation very limited regarding peripherals - there are no examples and no standalone libraries. <br>
Allwinner Drivers in Linux consist of thousand lines of code mixed with all Allwinner platforms and Linux libraries, I can't convert it to bare-metal.<br>
Why is this so ? Who knows. Maybe the peripherals in the SoC is intellectual property from external suppliers and can only be provided if you have a commercial agreement.<br>
Anyway, we have enthusiasts who are trying to do something: https://linux-sunxi.org/Allwinner_Nezha, https://github.com/hno/Allwinner-Info.

At one point, I discovered that in the RT-Thread OS (which is an small embedded OS) there is a HAL layer (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for the D1. This HAL is separated from the OS and is located in one place. A closer look reveals that this HAL quite similar to Linux drivers. Also [Melis OS](https://github.com/Tina-Linux/d1s-melis/) looks like RTOS from Allwinner and is has a similar HAL.<br>
I focused in RT-Thread spent a lot of time to understand boot process, debugging, run RT-Thread in D1H and manage to run MIPI DSI Display by HAL, also have a good progress with USB stack.<br>

So, this series of articles will cover the knowledge and experience I gained from working with the Allwinner D1H and RT-Thread.<br>
I hope someone finds something useful, RT-Thread have big potential as a bare-metal experimentation platform for the D1, as it includes many packages for GUI, audio, Ethernet, and more.<br>
Maybe someone can help me with USB driver, please. I am ready for issue reports and pull requests.<br>
Lets go to the next chapter.<br>

### TODO:
- try [PR](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/pull/9142) for d1s in d1h
- create RTT mirror and new PR for d1h common folder
- create new PR for display drivers
